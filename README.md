## General

Our software project titled "NSA 4 Dummies" is a small, lightweight application to show unencrpyted traffic and IP-Routing in your own home network. There's no need for further knowledge regarding network security, so this tool is for everyone who want's to get a fast and general overview of their data traffic.

"NSA 4 Dummies" was developed by a team of students from the "Technische Universität Ilmenau" during their mandatory 4th semester course called "Softwareprojekt".

Encrypted data isn't supposed to be logged and intruding secured networks isn't able with this application.
Using the software does not violate §202a, §202b, §202c StGB.
